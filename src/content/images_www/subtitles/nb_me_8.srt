Hi, this screencast demonstrates how to set upNetBeans IDE support for Oracle Java ME SDK8 Early Access on Windows.

2
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:21,232
To enable support for Oracle Java ME SDK 8 EAin NetBeans IDE, you need to:

3
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:27,599
download and install NetBeans IDE 8.0 Betafrom the NetBeans download page,

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,333
download and install Oracle Java ME SDK 8 EAfrom the Java ME SDK download page,

5
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:38,699
activate Java ME support inside the IDE,

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,800
and register Oracle Java ME SDK in NetBeansIDE.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Please note that it is strongly recommended touse JDK™ 8 Early Access.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,266
After you've downloaded and installed the Allbundle of NetBeans IDE from the Netbeans IDEdownload page,

9
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:02,432
go to the Java ME SDK download page,

10
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:07,399
click the Accept License Agreement option,

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,400
download the installer file, and save it to anylocation on your computer.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,100
Double-click the installer file to run the installer,and follow the instructions.

13
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,866
To activate Java ME support in the IDE, 
complete the following steps:

14
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:29,866
Choose Tools > Plugins from the main IDE'stoolbar.

00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,166
At the Welcome panel of the Installer dialog 
box, click Activate.

20
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:53,266
When the activation is successfully completed, 
click Finish.

21
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:59,632
The icon for the plugin in the left pane reflects 
the new status of the feature.

22
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:03,833
Click Close to close the Plugins dialog box.

23
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:12,333
To register the Oracle Java ME SDK 8 EA as a 
platform in NetBeans IDE, complete the 
following steps:

24
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:18,233
In the IDE, choose Tools > Java Platforms.

25
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:22,099
The Java Platform Manager dialog box displays.

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,600
Click Add Platform.

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:35,833
In the Select Platform Type panel of the Add 
Java Platform wizard, select Java ME CLDC 
Platform Emulator and click Next.

28
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:43,933
Select the directory you installed the Java ME 
SDK 8 EA Platform to and click Open.

29
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:50,633
Ensure Java ME SDK 8 EA is chosen and click 
Next.

30
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:56,133
As soon as the IDE detects the platform, click 
Finish.

31
00:02:56,133 --> 00:03:03,133
The Oracle Java ME SDK 8 EA is now 
registered in Netbeans IDE.

32
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,033
Click Close.

33
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:11,799
To create a Java ME 8 Embedded Project, you 
need to do the following:

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Choose File > New Project.

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:25,433
In the New Project dialog box, select Java ME 
Embedded in the Categories list and Java ME 
Embedded Application.

36
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,066
Click Next.

37
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:39,066
In the Name and Location panel of the New 
Project wizard, specify your project name and ensure that Java ME 8 EA Platform is chosen.

38
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:49,899
Please note that it is strongly recommended to 
use JDK 1.8 EA, from which the tools like javac 
or javadoc will be used.

39
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,100
Click Finish.

40
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,900
The IDE creates a new Java ME Embedded 
application project.

41
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,600
To customize a Java ME 8 embedded project, 
you can complete the following:

42
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,333
Right-click the project name and select 
Properties in the context menu.

43
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:18,533
Choose Platform in the Project Properties dialog 
box.

44
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:26,999
On this panel, you can specify the target JDK 
and Java Micro Edition platform for your project.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:38,500
You can also customize the devices used when 
running the project, Java ME configuration, 
profile, and optional packages 

46
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,033
to extend the runtime environment.

47
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:51,766
The Application Descriptor category allows for 
configuring such Java ME specific information as 
attributes that are written to the application's

48
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,466
JAD file and JAR's manifest,

49
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:56,932
a list of MIDlets in the Suite,

50
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,099
Push Registry,

51
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,266
and API Permissions.

52
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:07,132
The Signing category enables you to sign a Java 
ME application with the selected certificate.

53
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:15,899
On the Obfuscating panel, ProGuard can be 
used to make code more difficult to read for 
humans 

54
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,266
when they try to reverse engineer an application.

55
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:26,266
The Run category depends on the selected 
project's configuration.

56
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:32,666
It comprises command line options which are 
passed to a device when running the application,

57
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:40,499
the Run method that is a way of deploying built JAR or JAD onto an emulator or a device

58
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:48,900
in a regular way or via OTA which means that a JAD file is exposed via an http link,

59
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,300
which the device uses to download JAD and run 
the application. 

60
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,100
Click OK to close the dialog box.

61
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:09,100
To run a Java ME 8 Embedded project in the 
IDE, standard actions from the NetBeans toolbar 
or context menu are used.

62
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,533
Right-click the project name and choose Run 
from the context menu.

63
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:22,033
When you run your application, the IDE 
compiles and builds the application according to 
the project settings.

64
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:26,099
When you run your application, the IDE 
compiles and builds the application according to 
the project settings.

65
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:33,533
The output is shown in the device emulator as 
well as in the Output window of the IDE.

66
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:38,033
Thank you for watching.
